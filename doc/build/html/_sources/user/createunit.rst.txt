Create Crop2ML ModelUnit
========================

Recall that a Crop2ML ModelUnit is composed of its specification (meta-information) represented in a xml file to which is associated an algorithm representing the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of the model.

To create a Crop2ML ModelUnit in CropMStudio:

1. On the home interface click on "Model Creation"
2. Select *Model Unit*
3. Then fill the different tables  with the information related to the ModelUnit.General information (name, id, version, ...)
  * Declaration of inputs and outputs (click on Add to create a new row for a new input or output)
  * Select initialisation if needed 
  * A Parametersets section will appear if the ModelUnit contains parameters. In this case:
    + Create a Parameterset by filling its name and description
    + A table of the ModelUnit parameters will be opened. Then, set the parameters for unit tests. 
    + Other Parameterset can be created.
  * Finally, Testsets section appears.
    + Create a Testset by clicking on Create in Testset Line and by filling its name and description. Associate a Parameterset by selecting its name.
    + Create one or several tests in this Testset. To create a Test, select Create in Test line. Then, a table of the ModelUnit inputs and outputs will be opened. Then, set the inputs and the expected values of the outputs for unit tests. 
    + Several Testset can be created.
  
4. Exercise:
------------

Consider that you would like to create two simple ModelUnits in the Energy Balance package : Net Radiation and Net radiation in equivalent evaporation. Then in the next lines, the meta-information is provided with model equations in order to create two Crop2ML ModelUnits.
