Create a Crop2ML package
========================

In the context of large projects and collaborative work, it is useful to define some requirements or standards to facilitate common exchange. Crop2ML provides a logical, standardized but flexible support to facilitate model components sharing between modeling platforms through the definition of a directory structure
A **Crop2ML package** is a crop modelling exchange project with a specific structure and which contains Crop2ML files as xml files and algo, the sources files, data, tests and documentation

To access the structure of a Crop2ML package and for more information, please click `here <https://crop2ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/package.html#crop2ml-package-hierarchy>`_ 

This video will guide you to create a Crop2ML package from few information.

Consider that we would like to create a package of the **Energy balance model component**. We do that by providing the below information into the qgrid widget and click Apply
