**Welcome to Crop2ML Workshop**
===============================

This project describes the different phases of Crop2ML models lifecycle management

.. note::
   
   **Questions welcome!**

   This workshop is intended to introduce scientists in crop modeling domain how to use the Crop2ML framework to manage crop model components.
   Part of that is answering your questions. 
   Please let us know if you have any questions or difficulties by opening an issue on the Crop2MLWorkshop materials `Github repository page <https://github.com/AgriculturalModelExchangeInitiative/Crop2mlWorkshop/issues/new>`_. 
   Chances are good that if you have a question/problem, someone else is having the same question/problem. By reporting them as public issues, you are making it easier for us to help you and helping others to find answers in the future as there will be a searchable record of the problem and (hopefully) a solution.

   Once you are satisfied that your question/bug has been answered/solved, please close the issue or let us know that we may do so.
