========================================
| **Crop2ML** is a centralized framework proposed by the Agricultural Model Exhange Initiative (**AMEI**) to exchange and reuse the plant and crop process-based model (PBM) component between PBM frameworks.

| Any model component represented with this language will be called Crop2ML model.
