## Getting Started

The tutorial videos which will guide you throughout this workshop can be found [here](https://crop2mlworkshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

### Requirements

- Browser (tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Github Account (only necessary to report difficulties or errors encountered)

### Preparing for the workshop

- [optional] To track difficulties or errors encountered during the workshop, we would like to use Github issues. So  check that you can sign-in to Github, creating an account as necessary. 

- **Clone or Download** the [workshop materials repository](https://github.com/AgriculturalModelExchangeInitiative/Crop2mlWorkshop)::

     git clone https://github.com/AgriculturalModelExchangeInitiative/Crop2mlWorkshop.git

   If you did not install ``git`` you can download the repo from the [repository webpage](https://github.com/AgriculturalModelExchangeInitiative/Crop2mlWorkshop.git) (click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP")
   It contains:
    - A Crop2ML package in "examples" repository that will be used for a large view of Crop2MLSTudio.

- **Installation**

    - Try launching a mybinder instance by clicking on this [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AgriculturalModelExchangeInitiative/Pycrop2ml_ui.git/HEAD?urlpath=lab) icon (or the link below).
